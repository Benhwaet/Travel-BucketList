# Travel Bucket List

## Description

As a travel enthusiast, I want to use the Travel Bucket List Application to create and manage my dream
travel destinations in a user-friendly and organized manner. I want to be able to add new destinations to
my bucket list, mark them as visited, leave notes about my experiences, and visualize the locations on an
interactive map. Additionally, I would like the option to plan my trips further by accessing flight and
hotel information. Lastly, I want to be able to share my travel memories with others by uploading pictures
or linking my Instagram account.

## Project Goals

- User Registration and Authentication:
- Users can create an account with a unique username and secure password.
- Users can log in using their registered credentials.

### Bucket List Creation

- Users can search for travel destinations by name, country, continent, or category (e.g., historical places, natural wonders).
- Users can add destinations to their bucket list, providing basic information such as name, description, and an optional photo.

### Visited Destinations

- Users can mark destinations in their bucket list as visited to distinguish them from the ones yet to be experienced.

### Notes and Reviews

- Users can leave notes and reviews about the destinations they have visited, sharing their experiences with other users. ( Travel - Journal )

### Interactive Map

- Users can view their bucket list destinations displayed on an interactive map, with each destination represented by a pin or marker.
- Clicking on a marker provides additional information about the corresponding destination.

### Flights/Hotels Section

- Users can access a section that provides practical information about flights and hotels for the selected destinations.
- The information can be retrieved from a reliable third-party API or service.
- Photo Section or Instagram Integration:
- Users can upload pictures related to their travel experiences directly to the application.
- Alternatively, users can link their Instagram account to display their trip pictures.

### User Interface

- The application has a user-friendly and responsive interface, making it accessible on various devices, including desktops, - tablets, and smartphones.

### MVC Architecture

- The application follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) paradigm, maintaining a clear separation of concerns for code organization - and maintainability.

### Data Security

- Sensitive user information (e.g., passwords, API keys) is stored securely and protected using environment variables.
- Proper validation and sanitization of user inputs are implemented to prevent security vulnerabilities.

### Deployment

- The application is deployed on a web server and is accessible to users online.

### Quality Coding Standards

- The codebase follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, and quality comments.
- The repository is clean and well-organized.

## Presentation Requirements

- Use this Project Presentation TemplateLinks to an external site. to address the following:
- Elevator pitch: A one-minute description of your application.
- Concept: What is your user story? What was your motivation for development?
- Process: What were the technologies used? How were tasks and roles broken down and assigned? What
- challenges did you encounter? What were your successes?
- Demo: Show your stuff!
- Directions for future development.
- Links to the deployed application and the GitHub repository. Use the Guide to Deploy with Heroku and
- MySQLLinks to an external site. on The Full-Stack Blog if you need a reminder on how to deploy to Heroku.
